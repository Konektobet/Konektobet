    <h1>History of Gordon College</h1>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>Gordon College was an off-shoot of the Olongapo City Training Center, then a training center for skilled manpower for employment at the former Naval facility
        of the United States. With the facility's closure, and the slowing down of demand for skilled workers, City residents shifted to professional courses.
